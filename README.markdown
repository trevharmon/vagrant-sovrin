# Vagrant Environments for Sovrin

## Overview

The [Sovrin Foundation](https://www.sovrin.org/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing a platform to enable self-sovereign identities. From their website:

> Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an identity that is 100% owned and controlled by an individual or organization. No one else can read it, use it, turn it off, or take it away without its ownerâ€™s explicit consent. This simple form of identity is private, extremely secure, and goes where you go. This will enable trusted interactions to occur between individuals, institutions, and businesses.

Their underlying technology is open-source ([sovrin-foundation/sovrin](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin)), and community participation is strongly encouraged.

This repository contains a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) that will set up Sovrin in some test systems.
